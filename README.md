# techmeetupsng-bot
A bot that keeps you up to date with tech meetups, and makes it super easy to give feedback

## Problem statement
1. Keeping up with tech events you would want to attend in Lagos, Nigeria isn't very easy. There is a lot of meetups, a lot of noise, a lot going on. Fortunately, this seem to be the case in most major cities in the world.
2. Organizers of tech meetups find it very difficult to get feedback from people who attend their meetups. Less than 10% of surveys sent out are filled.

## How do we solve this?

TechMeetupsNG as a platform - bot and facebook page - gives you a single place to keep up with meetups in your preferred areas of interests.
The bot's super intuitive, aesthetically appealing UI makes giving feedback to events you've attended super easy.
